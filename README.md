# Complete guide Authentication using Asp.Net Core Identity and JWT token in the .Net core API
In this repo, all of these features related to Asp.Net core Identity have been implemented and a JWT token has been used to authenticate a user. Furthermore, to enforce external login, Google firebase has been used inside a react js application and based on the token that firebase generated, external authentication has been implemented. There is a text version explaining the whole process required to implement this kind of authentication inside the Medium. Furthermore, there is a Video version too to watch these processes.
